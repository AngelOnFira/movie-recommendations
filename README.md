## Adventure
[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) -There have been pretty cool comic-book villains on the big screen, but Thanos is really somebody who can take on multiple superheroes and come out unscathed. As yet, he has only been a presence behind the screen in MCU, pulling the strings, and it is in Infinity War that we will see what he is truly capable of.

[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zeland adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

## Action 
[Equalizer2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3766354/) - Robert McCall serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, but how far will he go when that is someone he loves?
## Drama
[Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) - Hackers are blamed for making a virus that will capsize five oil tankers.

[V For Vandetta](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409) - In a future British tyranny, a shadowy freedom fighter, known only by the alias of "V", plots to overthrow it with the help of a young woman.
