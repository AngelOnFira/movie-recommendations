## Adventure
[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zeland adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

### Drama
[Incendie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) - Overly slow and melodramatic, this movie is kinda sad. Kinda.

### Family
[The LEGO Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/) - This one is fun, clever, and extremely charming. And all animated in LEGO!
