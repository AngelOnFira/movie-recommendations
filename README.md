## Adventure
[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zeland adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

## Action
[American Gangster](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429) - An outcast New York City cop is charged with bringing down Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, whose real life inspired this partly biographical film. (Editors note: such a sick movie, check it)
